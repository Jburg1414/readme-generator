## Installation
npm i

## Usage
Clone or download the zip of my repo. Navigate to the file and in the terminal run npm i. Log into mysql and source db/schema.sql then exit out of mysql. In terminal log npm run seed, then log npm start. At that point the terminal is started so you can use a software like Insomnia to check the local host and run the application.
